# Thesis_-data_storage_revised-
This respository contains the required honors thesis that I had to complete in order to graduate in May 2023 as well as the R code that helped me do the exploratory data analysis and the regression model. 
While my written thesis involved more so of the performance of the model, in the R code I also went and did some testing, training and prediction as well.
