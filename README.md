# Thesis_-data_storage_revised-
This respository contains the required honors thesis that I had to complete in order to graduate in May 2023 as well as the R code that helped me do the exploratory data analysis and the regression model. 
The data for this project was acquired via The Violence Project, an online database that contains 200~ mass shooters as well as their attributes (such as mental illness, suicidailty, presence of bullying, etc).
